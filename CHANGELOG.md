UPDATE 1.1

For General
- Initial Github Release

For ANIM
- Cleaned up Main Menu
- Adjusted Options 1, 2, 3, and 4 to make created tiles span across the duration of the video, if 
  possible
- Added 'Reduced' Champion Icon support
- Adjusted Option 1 and 2 to automatically create standard Champion Icon sprite sheet
  and Reduced Champion sprite sheet at the same time
- Adjusted Options 1, 2, 3, and 4 to append some attributes to output folder/file names. For example:
   "_Champ" (if the output files/folders are for Champ Icons)
   "_Reduced" (if the output files/folders are for Reduced Champ Icons)
   "_Spray" (if the output files/folders are for Reduced Champ Icons)
   "_Bars" (if the output files/folders are Black Bar versions)
   "_Stretch" (if the output files/folders are Stretched versions)

- These attributes can stack too, i.e. "Aespa_Champ_Bars_Reduced"   
- Created Option 101: This option allows splitting of vanilla sprite sheets into tiles
- This supports:
  a. Animated Spray Sprite Sheets (4x4 tiles, 2048x2048px)
  b. Regular Champion Icons Sprite Sheets (6x10 tiles, 3588x3980px)
  b. Redeuced Champion Icons Sprite Sheets (5x8 tiles, 2000x2136px)
